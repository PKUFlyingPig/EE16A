## EECS16A : Designing Information Devices and Systems I

This is the introductory EE couse in UC Berkeley which will teach you the basics of linear algebra, circuits and machine learning. This repository contains all the learning materials for the 2020 summer version. Due to Covid-19, this course is taught completely online, you can learn this course completely online and ajust your learning rate.
