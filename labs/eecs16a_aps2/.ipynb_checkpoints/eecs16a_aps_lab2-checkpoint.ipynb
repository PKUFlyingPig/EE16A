    "Suppose we have $n$ beacons $B_0$, $B_1$, ... $B_{n - 1}$, so the position of a beacon $B_m$ in the 2-D plane will be $B_m = (x_m, y_m)$. These positions are known. We also have a receiver $R$ with unknown position $(x, y)$ in the same plane. Let $R_m$ denote the distance of $B_m$ to $R$, $R_m = \\sqrt{(x - x_m)^2 + (y - y_m)^2}$. \n",

    "\n",
    "Recall from last week that we find the distances from speakers to the microphone with the arrival time of the first beacon $t_0$. However in a real application like GPS finding $t_0$ is impossible. Thus we are unable to get the exact distances from the speakers to the microphone.
