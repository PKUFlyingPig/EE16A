The multipixel illumination patterns displayed by the virtual projector (remember the pop-up widgets from Imaging 2?) will come from a random binary matrix that you will generate. Before working on scanning your custom images, you'll walk through a basic multipixel imaging simulation to understand how it works, delve deeper into the differences between ideal and non-ideal imaging, and understand what makes certain matrices better at imaging in noisy systems than others.\n",

Diagonalization is not a concept you have learned yet, it will be covered in EECS16B, but for this lab, take our word that the $H$ matrix has $N$ linearly independent eigenvectors because of this property. With this, we know that the eigenvectors of $H$ form a basis for $\\mathbb{R}^N$, that is, a linearly independent set of vectors that span $\\mathbb{R}^N$.
