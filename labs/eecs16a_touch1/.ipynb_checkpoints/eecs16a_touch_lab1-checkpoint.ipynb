    "Welcome to the first lab of the touchscreen module! In this module, you will build 2 different touchscreen systems introduced in lecture. Before we can play around with the touchscreens, we have to first learn some hardware fundamentals. In today's lab, we will be working with a simple functional circuit - an LED circuit. We will also work on building up your understanding of breadboarding - the remainder of the touchscreen module will rely heavily on your ability to use and debug a breadboard."

You do not need to know what it does for now, and will have plenty of exposure with it in the coming lectures. However, as you may have realized already, breadboarding is not much of a test of your circuits knowledge, but more of a brain puzzle, trying to translate circuit schematics onto a breadboard, so we will attempt this final challenge using this new mystery component. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the circuit schematic, the Op Amp is the triangle, and has 5 connections coming out of it. In TinkerCAD and in the physical world, the Op Amp looks like a black rectangle with 8 legs coming out of it. We will provide you with the **pin out diagram** of the Op Amp chip (LM741) where you can see what connections on the rectangular chip correspond to the Op Amp circuit component.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, we have started the breadboard for you - it includes the Op Amp (with the white dot on the top left), the potentiometer, LED, and a few connections. Don't forget the wires on the bottom of the breadboard - they are connecting the two power rails and ground rails on each side of the breadboard. \n",

    "\n",
    "1. Trace each node. TinkerCAD will highlight all the breadboard rows and component pins that are connected to the same node.\n",
    "1. Cross check the schematic and your breadboard to see if enough \"things\" are connected to each node. For example, the node above the LED should be connecting to two \"things\", namely the 330 Ohm resistor and the positive leg of the LED.\n",
    "1. Use wire colors to indicate wires that are the same node. This will help organize your thought process.\n",
